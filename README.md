# NLDL-Synthetic-data-tutorial

Welcome to the hands-on part of the NLDL tutorial for Innovative Uses of Synthetic Data! 
In this repository you will find materials required to complete the Lab.

The Lab will start on Monday, 8 January 2023, 10:00 CET.
It is designed to be approximately an hour and a half and will be presented alongside a talk presented by Prof Mihaela van der Schaar which will make up the rest of the 3 hour session.

## Before the lab

We will run the hands-on session using Google Colab. As a benefit, there is no need to pre-install any library or download any dataset.

For the physical participants, please bring with you **a fully charged laptop** for the session and bear in mind that there may not be enough power sockets for everyone at the venue. 
Any available sockets are allocated on a first come, first served basis. 

The Lab is based on the open-source Python library [synthcity](https://github.com/vanderschaarlab/synthcity). 
To make the most out of the Lab, we recommend the participants to explore the library beforehand. Here is a list of useful materials:

- The [whitepaper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07573) on synthcity and innovative uses of synthetic data
- The [NeurIPS 2023 paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=uIppiU2JKP)
- The GitHub repository of [synthcity](https://github.com/vanderschaarlab/synthcity)
- The synthcity [documentation](https://synthcity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 



## During the lab

### We will cover

| Session Title | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| Data Modality | We demonstrate how synthcity can generate tabular data with diverse modalities, including static data, regular and irregular time series, data with censoring, multi-source data, and composite data. | 
| Fairness| We show how synthetic data can promote ML fairness by (1) augmenting minority classes with conditional generation and (2) removing bias via causal generation. |
| Privacy | We introduce privacy-preserving synthetic data generators that facilitates sharing of sensitive data. We will cover differential-privacy based methods as well as methods that defend against specific threat models.|
| Transfer | We show how to alleviate data scarcity by augmenting a small dataset using information learned from other related datasets in a transfer learning style.|
| Further Engagement | We discuss ways of further engaging with the application and development of synthcity.|
